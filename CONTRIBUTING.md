# Contributing

### Overview

* Fork iron to your own account
* Create a feature branch, namespaced by.
  * bug/...
  * feat/...
  * test/...
  * doc/...
  * refactor/...
* Make commits to your feature branch. Prefix each commit like so:
  * (feat) Added a new feature
  * (fix) Fixed inconsistent tests [Fixes #0]
  * (refactor) ...
  * (cleanup) ...
  * (test) ...
  * (doc) ...
* Make a pull request with your changes directly to master. Include a
  description of your changes.
* Wait for one of the reviewers to look at your code and either merge it or
  give feedback which you should adapt to.

### The Merge Process

1. You make a pull request
2. A reviewer looks at your pull request
  if the pull request is mergeable (i.e. no conflicts)
    a. The reviwer approves your pull request and merges it.
    b. The review does not approve your pull request.
      ba. Respond to changes and goto 2.
  if the pull request is not mergeable
    a. The reviewer will ask you to rebase your changes from master so there
    are no more conflicts and the commit history remains clean.
